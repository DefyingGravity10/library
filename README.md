# library

Access the project [here](https://defyinggravity10.github.io/library/).

## Description

This project is an implementation of the front-end of a library application.

It was written using `HTML`, `Tailwind CSS` and `JavaScript`.

## Features and Limitations

1. The application allows its users to add new books, and delete books currently in the library.
2. The `read` status of each book can be easily modified.
3. There is yet to be any form of storage.

## Languages and Frameworks

This project was made in an attempt for me to learn `Tailwind CSS` and also serves as my review of `JavaScript.` Given this, the languages and frameworks used are as follows:

- `HTML`
- `CSS` (minimal)
- `Tailwind CSS`
- `JavaScript`
